| RUST006 | Potential DoS Vulnerabilities             | High     | Allocations based on untrusted input sizes can lead to DoS via memory exhaustion.                              | Validate input sizes before allocations and use bounded collections. Consider rate-limiting or other mitigation strategies. |
| RUST007 | Missing Boundary Checks                   | Medium   | Accessing arrays or vectors without boundary checks can lead to panics or buffer overflows.                    | Use `.get()` or `.get_mut()` for safe access with bounds checking, and handle the Option result appropriately.   |
| RUST008 | Unnecessary Cloning of Large Data Structures | Low    | Cloning large data structures can lead to performance issues due to excessive memory use.                      | Prefer borrowing or using reference-counted types like `Rc` or `Arc` to share data without deep copying.          |
| RUST009 | Blocking I/O in Asynchronous Code         | Medium   | Performing blocking I/O operations in async contexts can lead to thread starvation and reduced scalability.    | Use asynchronous equivalents for file and network operations within async functions.                             |
| RUST010 | Misuse of Arc<Mutex<T>>                   | Medium   | Incorrect use of Arc<Mutex<T>> can lead to deadlocks or inefficient locking mechanisms.                        | Ensure that locks are held for the minimum duration necessary, and consider other synchronization primitives like RwLock if applicable. |
| RUST011 | Improper Implementation of Drop Trait     | Medium   | Incorrect custom implementations of the Drop trait can lead to resource leaks or panic safety issues.           | Implement the Drop trait carefully, ensuring that errors are handled gracefully and resources are properly released. |
| RUST012 | Usage of mem::uninitialized and mem::zeroed | High    | Using mem::uninitialized or mem::zeroed can lead to undefined behavior if the type has any non-zero or complex initialization requirements. | Prefer using safe initialization patterns and avoid these functions for
