|----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RUST001  | Undefined Behavior                            | Critical | Operations that could lead to undefined behavior, such as dereferencing a raw pointer or accessing arrays out-of-bounds without proper checks. | Ensure all accesses within unsafe blocks are checked and validated to prevent undefined behavior. Use safe abstractions where possible. |
| RUST002  | Data Races                                    | High     | Concurrent data access without proper synchronization can lead to data races.                                       | Use synchronization primitives like Mutex or RwLock to safeguard against data races in concurrent operations.      |
| RUST003  | Dangling Pointers                             | Critical | Use of pointers that may no longer be valid, leading to dangling pointers.                                           | Ensure that any pointer or reference is valid for the duration of its use. Consider using smart pointers for safer memory management. |
| RUST004  | Buffer Overflows                              | High     | Accessing arrays or vectors with unchecked indices, potentially leading to buffer overflows.                        | Use the `.get()` or `.get_mut()` methods for accessing elements by index safely.                                    |
| RUST005  | Aliasing Rules Violation                      | Medium   | Mutable aliasing that could lead to data races or undefined behavior.                                                | Ensure that mutable references do not alias by using exclusive access patterns.                                     |
| RUST006  | Memory Leaks                                  | Medium   | Improper use of memory allocation that could result in memory leaks.                                                 | Ensure proper deallocation of resources and consider using smart pointers correctly to prevent leaks.               |
| RUST007  | Uninitialized Memory                          | High     | Use of uninitialized memory, which can lead to undefined behavior.                                                   | Use `MaybeUninit<T>` for safer initialization of memory.                                                            |
| RUST009  | Type Punning and Transmutation                | High     | Unsafe type conversions that can break type safety.                                                                 | Avoid using `transmute` where possible. Prefer safe conversion methods or carefully validate transmutations.        |
| RUST010  | Manual Memory Management Errors               | High     | Manual allocation, deallocation, or manipulation of memory, risking errors like double frees or use-after-free.     | Use Rust's ownership and borrowing system as much as possible, and ensure manual memory management is error-free when necessary. |
| RUST011  | Use After Free                                | Critical | Accessing memory after it has been freed, leading to potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.                        | Ensure that pointers or references to memory are not used after the memory has been deallocated. Use lifetime tracking features in Rust to manage memory safely. |
| RUST012  | Integer Overflow                              | High     | Arithmetic operations that may overflow, leading to incorrect calculations or vulnerabilities.                      | Use checked arithmetic functions like `checked_add` to prevent overflows.                                           |
| RUST013  | Improper Access Control                       | Medium   | Exposing unsafe blocks or functions publicly without proper encapsulation or safety checks.                          | Minimize the visibility of unsafe code. Encapsulate unsafe operations within safe abstractions whenever possible.   |
| RUST014  | Race Condition in Unsafe Code                 | High     | Concurrency issues within unsafe blocks that could lead to race conditions.                                          | Employ proper synchronization mechanisms even within unsafe blocks to prevent race conditions.                      |
| RUST015  | Unsafe Trait Implementation                   | Medium   | Implementing traits unsafely, which might lead to undefined behavior if the trait's contract is not properly upheld. | Ensure that unsafe trait implementations strictly adhere to their expected contracts and behaviors.                 |
| RUST016  | Insecure Randomness                           | Medium   | Use of insecure or non-cryptographically secure random number generators.                                            | Use a cryptographically secure random number generator like `rand::thread_rng()` for security-critical applications.|
| RUST017  | Panics in Unsafe Code                         | Medium   | Using `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` within unsafe blocks, which may lead to panics in scenarios where error handling is critical. | Handle errors gracefully in unsafe code to avoid panicking, using `Result` and error handling patterns instead of `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`. |
| RUST018  | Misuse of Sync and Send Traits                | High     | Incorrectly implementing `Sync` or `Send` traits, potentially leading to data races in concurrent contexts.         | Carefully audit and ensure correctness when manually implementing `Sync` or `Send` to uphold Rust's safety guarantees. |
| RUST019  | Unsafe Block in Public Interface              | Medium   | Exposing unsafe blocks through a public interface, increasing the risk of misuse by external callers.                | Avoid exposing unsafe operations in public APIs. Provide safe wrappers to encapsulate unsafe operations internally.  |
| RUST020  | Unsafe Dereferencing                          | High     | Dereferencing pointers without ensuring they point to valid memory, leading to potential segmentation faults or undefined behavior. | Verify the validity of pointers before dereferencing, especially in unsafe contexts. Consider using references or smart pointers when possible. |
